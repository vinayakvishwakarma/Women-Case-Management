<h1><b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS<b></h1>
<button class="accordion">1 What happens when i file the complaint?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>If you've submitted a complaint about issues such as availability, billing, privacy or service, your complaint is being processed by the FCC's Consumer Inquiries and Complaints Division.  You will be given a tracking number and you will receive periodic emails about the status of your complaint.  You may be contacted by an FCC consumer representative if more information is necessary to complete your complaint.  When all required information has been gathered, the FCC either responds to you by providing relevant educational material or sends your complaint to the service provider.  The provider is required to respond in writing to the complaint within 30 days of receipt of the complaint.  The Provider must provide you and the FCC with a copy of the response.  The provider will likely contact you to resolve your complaint. 

Complaints about issues such as loud commercials, the Do Not Call List, robocalls, unwanted telephone calls, unsolicited faxes and similar issues covered by the Telephone Consumer Protection Act are not served but are shared among FCC bureaus and offices.  We do not resolve individual complaints on these issues and you will not receive status emails about your complaint. However, the collective data we receive helps us keep a pulse on what consumers are experiencing, may lead to investigations and serves as a deterrent to the companies we regulate.

Does the FCC contact me directly about my complaint? 

No, the FCC serves your complaint on your provider(s) and the provider is obligated to respond to your complaint within 30 days and provide the FCC with a copy of that response.  It is likely that your provider(s) will contact you to attempt to resolve your complaint. </p>

The carrier response did not solve my complaint. What can I do?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>If you believe the carrier response you received was insufficient, you may send rebuttal information to the FCC by replying to the email that you were sent by the FCC.  The FCC will review your information and determine if it is sufficient to send to the provider triggering a new obligation to respond.  If your additional information actually constitutes a new complaint, you will be asked to fill out a new form. Another option is filing a formal complaint with the FCC.</p>
